Shaper2D v2 by Andrii Sudyn

To start using Shaper2D just select this from Unity's main menu:
	GameObject > 2D Object > Shaper 2D

That's it! After the object appears on the scene you can adjust its properties
in the inspector window.

If you have any questions, you can contact me.

And if you like this extension, I'll be grateful if you give it a rating on
Unity Asset Store. This would increase it's popularity and make sure I
keep making it better.
